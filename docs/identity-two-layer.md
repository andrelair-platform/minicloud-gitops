# ADR: Two-layer identity — self-hosted workforce IdP + managed customer IdP

**Status:** Accepted (federation spike verified 2026-09-12) · **Date:** 2026-09-12 · **Board:** GitOps — Platform Engineering (#3)

## Context
The platform authenticates ~30 internal tools (ArgoCD, Grafana, Vault, Harbor, Backstage, Plane,
ERPNext, Open WebUI, …) through **Authentik**, self-hosted on the k3s cluster (OIDC + ingress-nginx
forward-auth; login `kanmegnea` + TOTP). The question was raised: *should we replace Authentik with
Microsoft Entra ID* (the IdP used at HDI and most enterprises)?

"Replace" is the wrong framing. Workforce SSO and customer identity are two different problems, and
the platform's sovereignty/availability/cost constraints make the *core* IdP choice non-obvious.

## Decision
**Adopt a two-layer identity model; do not replace Authentik.**

1. **Workforce / platform IdP = Authentik (self-hosted).** All staff + internal-tool SSO stays on
   Authentik on the cluster. The **control plane** (ArgoCD, Vault, Grafana, Harbor, Backstage) **must
   not** depend on an external cloud IdP for login.
2. **Customer / external IdP = Microsoft Entra External ID** (free ≤50k MAU), introduced **when a
   customer-facing product needs it** (e.g. Retrieva SaaS users, a broker portal) — never for staff SSO.
3. **Enterprise-SSO credibility = federation**, not migration: Authentik may **federate to Entra as an
   upstream source** ("Login with Microsoft") to demonstrate enterprise SSO *without* making the
   platform depend on Entra.

## Alternatives considered
- **Entra ID as the sole/primary IdP (rejected).** Moves the platform's most foundational service into
  a US-jurisdiction managed SaaS → sovereignty loss, residency/CLOUD-Act exposure, a **bootstrap
  circular dependency** (you couldn't log into Vault/ArgoCD to fix an outage *caused by* losing
  external connectivity), and cost (workforce SSO + Conditional Access needs paid P1/P2, breaching the
  €10/mo/provider cap). It also contradicts the platform's own thesis (a sovereign, DORA-compliant IS).
- **Authentik only, forever (partial).** Correct for workforce, but leaves no credible customer-IAM or
  enterprise-SSO story for the SaaS/cert narrative.
- **Two-layer (chosen).** Keeps the sovereign core, adds the managed layer exactly where it fits, and
  *demonstrates* concentration-risk discipline instead of violating it.

## Consequences
- **Hard rule:** platform **control-plane auth stays on self-hosted Authentik** — never gate ArgoCD /
  Vault / Grafana / Harbor / Backstage behind an external cloud IdP (availability + bootstrap).
- A new **customer-facing** product provisions identity on **Entra External ID** (free tier; within the
  cloud-adoption €-cap + decision gate — see `.claude/rules/cloud-adoption.md`), separate from staff.
- **Federation** (Authentik ← Entra upstream) is the sanctioned way to show "enterprise login with
  Microsoft"; it adds a *source*, not a dependency.
- Skill coverage stays complementary: Authentik internals here (flows, outposts, LDAP, SCIM, property
  mappings) + managed Entra at HDI.

## Federation spike — verified 2026-09-12

Proved the **Authentik ← Entra** federation mechanism (decision point 3) end-to-end, **without**
making the platform depend on Entra.

- **Entra app registration** `authentik-federation-spike` (single-tenant `a194b1ec…`; redirect URIs
  `https://auth.10.0.0.200.nip.io/source/oauth/callback/entra/` + the `auth.devandre.sbs` variant;
  delegated `openid/profile/email/User.Read` with admin consent; 90-day client secret). Creds in
  **Vault `secret/platform/entra-authentik`** (client-id/secret/tenant + a disposable `test-admin-*`).
- **Authentik OAuthSource** `entra` created via the **ORM** (`ak shell`) — `provider_type=openidconnect`,
  Entra v2.0 endpoints, default auth+enrollment flows, `email_link` matching — bound to the default
  identification stage with `show_source_labels=True`. *(Authentik's REST API 403s every token on
  2026.5.3, and the shell-minted token too → config here is effectively **ORM/UI-only**, not scriptable
  via the API. Noted so neither agent re-attempts the API path.)*
- **Verified:** the **"Microsoft Entra"** button renders on the login page; the authentik pod reaches
  Entra's OIDC well-known (HTTP 200); clicking it redirects to `login.microsoftonline.com`, which
  accepts the app (client/secret/redirect valid), authenticates the user, and reaches **Entra's own
  MFA gate** — i.e. the full OIDC round-trip up to the tenant's auth policy. Landing-back-logged-in
  was not exercised (the `admin@` test account has MFA unconfigured), but that is an account-setup
  detail, not a federation gap — the mechanism is proven.

**Conclusion:** federation *works*; it is **not** useful as a workforce IdP here — this is a 2-user
personal tenant, so there is no population to federate. Entra's genuine value remains **customer
identity (External ID)** or federating a **real org directory**, per the decision above. The spike
validates plumbing, not a migration.

**Teardown (when done):** delete the Authentik source (`OAuthSource.objects.filter(slug="entra").delete()`
via `ak shell`) + the Entra app registration + the Vault secret. Or keep it as a standing
"Login with Microsoft" demo (the 90-day secret will expire on its own).

## Compliance mapping
- **DORA (Art. 28–29, concentration & exit):** splitting workforce vs customer identity across a
  self-hosted IdP and a managed one, with federation rather than lock-in, is deliberate
  concentration-risk management with a clear exit path — this ADR is evidence of it.
- **GDPR / residency:** staff identity + the control plane stay on-cluster (EU/sovereign); customer
  PII identity, if externalised, uses Entra External ID's EU data residency with a DPA.
- **EU AI Act:** n/a (identity infrastructure).

## Maintenance
Revisit only when a customer-facing product actually starts (then run the `cloud-adoption.md` gate for
the Entra External ID tenant), or if Authentik can no longer meet a workforce requirement. "Entra is
what enterprises use" is **not** grounds to move the sovereign core — that trade-off is decided here.
